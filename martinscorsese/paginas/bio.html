                    Scorsese was a frail asthmatic child who grew up in the Italian American neighbourhood of Little Italy on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His early interest in film returned after he tried unsuccessfully to enter the Roman Catholic priesthood, and he went on to earn undergraduate (1964) and graduate (1966) degrees in film from New York University, where he subsequently taught. His student films showed a wide range of influences, from foreign classics to Hollywood musicals. Among them were shorts such as What’s a Nice Girl like You Doing in a Place like This? (1963) and It’s Not Just You, Murray! (1964).
                    Scorsese’s first theatrical film, Who’s That Knocking at My Door (1967), was an intimate portrayal of life in the streets of Little Italy. Harvey Keitel (who went on to do five more films with Scorsese in the 1970s and ’80s) starred as Scorsese’s alter ego, a streetwise but sensitive Italian American Catholic plagued by the knowledge that his girlfriend (Zina Bethune) had been raped. The film earned Scorsese encouraging reviews, and he was offered the position of assistant director and supervising editor on Woodstock (1970),which translated into converting the more than 100 hours of raw footage of the 1969 rock concert into a 3-hour movie that won an Academy Award for best documentary.

                    Scorsese directed a less widely seen documentary about protests against the Vietnam War, Street Scenes (1970), and he then worked as an editor on the concert films Medicine Ball Caravan (1971) and Elvis on Tour (1972). Producer Roger Corman invited him to direct Boxcar Bertha (1972). Scorsese made the most of the opportunity with an exciting if ultimately empty yarn about train robbers (Barbara Hershey, David Carradine, and Bernie Casey) wreaking havoc in the Depression-era South.

                    Having proved that he could make a fairly conventional movie, Scorsese then shocked filmgoers with Taxi Driver (1976), a hellish tour of a disturbed Vietnam veteran’s peculiar madness. Brilliantly written by Paul Schrader, photographed by Michael Chapman, and scored by Bernard Herrmann (his final film), this unsettling work is as fascinating as it is horrifying. De Niro gave what is regarded as his definitive performance as the pathetically alienated but dangerously unhinged Travis Bickle, and Keitel exuded menace in the small but key role of the seductive pimp Sport, who keeps the 12-year-old Iris (Jodie Foster) in thrall. Perhaps the most controversial, and the most disturbing, Oscar nominee for best picture to date, Taxi Driver also earned Oscar nominations for De Niro, Foster, and Herrmann. Scorsese cast himself in a small but telling cameo as a murderously jealous husband, and the film was awarded the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival. Many rank it as Scorsese’s best work.

                    Scorsese’s artistic risk taking had been vindicated, but his status as Hollywood’s newest enfant terrible lasted only until the release of New York, New York (1977), a rethinking of the 1950s Hollywood musical, marked by nonnaturalistic lighting and elaborate sets. Deliberately stylized to evoke past screen triumphs by Vincente Minnelli and George Cukor, it featured De Niro as the cocky Jimmy Doyle, a novice saxophone player who works in a big band behind talented singer Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli). Their torrid love affair proves impossible to sustain, and the vain, self-destructive Jimmy drifts away from domestic bliss with the pregnant Francine. De Niro was compelling in an unsympathetic part, and Minnelli evoked her mother (Judy Garland) with frightening authority. While critical opinion was mixed, it was a commercial flop. However, the film later developed a cult following largely because of its obvious affection for old Hollywood.

                <p class="text80s" data-aos="fade-left">
                    Scorsese then made the brutal but beautiful Raging Bull (1980). Loosely adapted by Schrader and Mardik Martin from the memoir of former middleweight boxing champ Jake La Motta, this vitriolic essay on the pleasurable pain of violence is immediately impressive for its stunning black-and-white cinematography by Michael Chapman and for its meticulous re-creation of 1940s New York City. The acting was also first-rate, particularly that of Joe Pesci as Joey, Jake’s loyal brother, and Cathy Moriarty as Vickie, Jake’s abused wife. But it is De Niro’s towering, Oscar-winning performance as the self-destructive La Motta, a proud but foolish man undone by forces he can neither understand nor control, that unified this pitiless psychodrama. Raging Bull has come to be regarded as one of Scorsese’s greatest films.

                    In The King of Comedy (1982), De Niro gave yet another wholly original performance—this time, as Rupert Pupkin, a self-styled stand-up TV comedian. Blissfully unaware of his profound lack of talent, Rupert practices his pathetic comedy routines to no avail. Finally he kidnaps reigning late-night TV star Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) in exchange for a 10-minute stint on his program. The film failed at the box office but later climbed in critical regard. 

                    The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) was, but for some protests from conservative Christians prior to its release, a well-received version of Nikos Kazantzákis’s epic novel (adapted by Schrader) about the self-doubts of Jesus as he carries out his mission. Willem Dafoe was well cast as Jesus, but some critics had problems with the more unusual casting of Keitel as Judas, Hershey as Mary Magdalene, and Harry Dean Stanton as Paul. The evocative cinematography by Ballhaus and the neotraditional score by Peter Gabriel enlivened this variation on the Gospels, which earned Scorsese his second Oscar nomination.

                <p class="text90s" data-aos="fade-right">

                    Another kind of New York story—the kind that helped fashion Scorsese’s reputation—was the basis of the acclaimed GoodFellas (1990). Adapted from Nicholas Pileggi’s nonfiction Wiseguy, this knowing portrait of small-time Brooklyn mobster Henry Hill’s life and crimes (scripted by Pileggi and Scorsese) was as authentic as any Scorsese film since Raging Bull. Ray Liotta played Hill, and Paul Sorvino, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and De Niro excelled in their supporting roles, particularly Pesci, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Hill’s short-tempered friend Tommy DeVito. Scorsese displayed his mastery of the medium in new and unexpected ways, especially in a much-studied tracking shot that followed Hill through a crowded restaurant. Scorsese was again Oscar nominated, both for directing and, with Pileggi, for best adapted screenplay.

                    The commercially successful Cape Fear (1991) was an ultraviolent remake of a suspenseful 1962 film. Nolte starred as Sam Bowden, a Southern lawyer whose family is terrorized by ex-con Max Cady (De Niro), who blames the lawyer for his prison conviction and seeks revenge. Screenwriter Wesley Strick’s script complicated the premise of the original by making Bowden culpable on several levels, from his framing of Cady 14 years earlier to his current infidelity to his wife (Jessica Lange).

                    The 1970s Las Vegas morality tale Casino (1995) marked the return of the GoodFellas talent pool, reuniting Scorsese with screenwriter Pileggi and actors De Niro and Pesci, but it did not receive the critical acclaim or commercial success of the earlier film. Casino had an epic running time of just short of three hours, and the De Niro-Pesci pairing had little of the chemistry seen in GoodFellas. However, the film had excellent supporting performances (especially by Sharon Stone, Alan King, James Woods, Don Rickles, and Dickie Smothers).

                    Gangs of New York (2002) was a project Scorsese had sought to film since the late 1970s. It had an epic canvas: the chaotic peril of 1860s New York City, culminating in the Draft Riot of 1863. Leonardo DiCaprio (in the first of a number of films he did with Scorsese) starred as Amsterdam Vallon, a young man seeking to avenge the death of his father at the hands of Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis at his most mordant), a kind of godfather to the unruly Five Points mobs. Gangs of New York was nominated for 10 Oscars, including nods for best picture and director.

                    The Aviator (2004) was a biopic of aviator and movie producer Howard Hughes, and Scorsese lavishly re-created 1930s and 1940s Hollywood. As Hughes, DiCaprio gave an appropriately intense interpretation of a man driven by both his own genius and an acute case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The film was a box-office success and garnered 11 Oscar nominations, including best picture and director. 

                    Scorsese then made The Departed (2006), which was based on the Hong Kong action film Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs, 2002). DiCaprio and Matt Damon starred as doppelgängers who live on opposite sides of the law—Billy (DiCaprio) as an undercover cop assigned the highly perilous task of penetrating the organization of crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, submitting one of his showiest performances as a psychopathic mastermind based on Boston mobster Whitey Bulger) and Colin (Damon) as a Boston detective raised since childhood by Frank to become his mole. The film became one of Scorsese’s biggest box-office hits, and it enabled him to finally win an Oscar for best director. The film itself also won for best picture.

                    Shutter Island (2010) starred DiCaprio as a U.S. marshal who in 1954 travels to a psychiatric facility isolated in Boston Harbor to search for a missing patient. However, it soon becomes clear that what began as a noirish detective story has become something much closer to a horror movie. DiCaprio’s hard-boiled mien played well against Ben Kingsley’s Dr. Cawley, the crafty, evasive director of the gothic facility. Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow, and Jackie Earle Haley also provided top-notch support. The film was as much a box-office smash as The Departed, but reviews were not as universally enthusiastic.

                    He returned to his familiar New York City haunts with The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), a cautionary tale based on the memoir by Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), a stock trader who fell afoul of the law but not before showering himself and his associates in tremendous wealth. The film divided critics, who saw it as either condemning or celebrating Belfort and his excesses. Scorsese received his eighth Oscar nomination for best director, and the film itself was nominated for best picture. 

                    Scorsese next helmed and cowrote the feature film Silence (2016), which was based on a novel by Endō Shūsaku. The epic drama—which Scorsese had wanted to make for nearly 30 years—continued his exploration of faith. It centres on Jesuit missionaries in 17th-century Japan who face torture or death if they do not renounce Catholicism. Many critics praised the film as among Scorsese’s better works. In 2019 Scorsese directed the documentary Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese, recounting the musician’s freewheeling 1975 tour. Later that year The Irishman appeared, first in theatres and then on Netflix. The mob drama reunited Scorsese with De Niro, and it marked the first time he directed Al Pacino. The film, which received widespread acclaim, centres on a hit man (De Niro) who allegedly killed labour leader Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). The Irishman garnered 10 Oscar nominations, including one for best picture. In addition, Scorsese earned his ninth nod for best director.

                    Despite the diversity in his chosen subject matter, Scorsese’s work contains common elements. His simultaneous fondness for and rebellion against old Hollywood is demonstrated by his exploring anew clichéd plot devices that often culminate in bleak irony and moral ambiguity. He has been praised for his use of the subjective camera to portray the protagonist’s point of view, an approach characterized by such subtle touches as right-to-left camera pans that move contrary to normal eye movement and thereby create a slightly disconcerting effect and suggest a subjectively distorted world. Scorsese’s films tend to be concerned with people rather than plots, and he is fond of placing his characters in volatile situations and allowing events to unfold naturally, as determined by the characters’ instincts, lusts, and obsessions. One of the most important filmmakers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Scorsese reflects in his work both a cynicism toward modern culture and an obvious love of the cinema.
